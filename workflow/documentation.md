#### pgt

pgt.gff : 280 genes extracted from annotations for CRL 75-36-700-3_280 with genes
transformed to be positive strand_landmarks

pgt.fna : 280 genes extracted from an assembly of CRL 75-36-700-3_280

#### pst

pst.gff : 388 genes extracted from annotations for PST-130 with genes transformed
to be positive strand_landmarks. Since annotations did not include CDS,
extra CDS have been added which are simply duplicate coordinates of exons.

pst.fna : 280 genes extracted from an assembly of PST-130

### Tree Input

pgt_all.ffn.gz : TODO: add this.

pgt_subset.ffn.gz : TODO: add this.

pst_all.ffn.gz : CDS (technically exons) of 388 genes, extracted from 57 isolates.

pst_subset.ffn.gz : CDS (technically exons) of 388 genes, extracted from 8 isolates.
